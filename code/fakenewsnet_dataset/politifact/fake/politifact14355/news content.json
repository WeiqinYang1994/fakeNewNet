A raid of his cell weeks ago allegedly found \u201ctoxic pills\u201d inside it, though these are likely to be prescription drugs and anti-depressants, which might also be used in a suicide attempt.\n\nThe Pistorius family told the Sunday paper that they were not aware of any investigation into Pistorius\u2019 alleged plot against the prison staff. They dismissed it as yet another sensationalist story like many others.\n\nSource: mzansilive.co.za", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ryjd.webp?resize=364%2C205&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ad39126820df52970e311d391d31e5b9?s=80&d=mm&r=g", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/visa.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Oluseye-Ogunlesi-e1662586279714.jpg?resize=192%2C96&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/howafricared.png?fit=320%2C190&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=36&d=mm&r=g", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/que-1-e1662991308674.jpg?resize=192%2C96&ssl=1", "https://bimber-demo-content.localhost/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/footer_stamp.png", "https://howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Oscar-Pistorius-1.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Suffering-From-Diabetes-Just-Boil-These-Leaves-And-Solve-Your-Problem-Without-Medications.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1", "https://howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Untitled4-1.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ad39126820df52970e311d391d31e5b9?s=40&d=mm&r=g", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Marcus-Mosby-e1661593774885.jpeg?resize=364%2C205&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Khaby-Lame.jpg?resize=192%2C96&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Cameroonian-woman-arrested-at-airport-while-trying-to-flee-after-allegedly-killing-2-and-injuring-one-in-Midtown-Atlanta.png?resize=364%2C205&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Oscar-Pistorius.jpg?resize=364%2C205&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/joseph_m_grant_70-year-old_man_graduate_college.jpg?resize=192%2C96&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/court_hammer.jpg?resize=364%2C205&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/queen-elizabeth-and-prince-Charles.webp?resize=364%2C205&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/6318489113634.webp?resize=364%2C205&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jackie-Appiah-2.jpg?resize=192%2C96&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/indentured-e1662585451983.jpg?resize=364%2C205&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Musa-Kamara.jpg?resize=364%2C205&ssl=1", "https://howafrica.com/wp-content/plugins/siteguard/really-simple-captcha/tmp/1242197391.png", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Dorothy-Nabulime.png?resize=364%2C205&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Image-e1662712593761.jpeg?resize=364%2C205&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Xandy-Kamel.jpg?resize=192%2C96&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://howafrica.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Oscar-Pistorius-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://howafrica.com/oscar-pistorius-attempts-commit-suicide/", "title": "Oscar Pistorius Attempts To Commit Suicide", "meta_data": {"description": "The former Paralympic athlete reportedly tried to commit suicide.
