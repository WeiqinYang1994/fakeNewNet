Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was \u201cbuilt by immigrants.\u201d\n\nFact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE\n\nWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not \u201cimmigrants\u201d but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/08/48771985803_11bc25d0fe_k-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/09/Huntr-victory-200x150.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/man-walks-Central-Intelligence-Agency-cia-logo-lobby-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/hallebaileymermaid1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/09/GettyImages-1423959207-2-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/01/us-army-soldiers-return-filefeb14-salute-flag-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/mar_a_lago2-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/09/marthas-vineyard-getty-ap-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/12/wi/afp/27/37m88uh-e1504217005343-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/09/GettyImages-1234073436-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/08/kanyewestsuesohio1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/09/45th-Congressional-Hispanic-Caucus-Institute-Gala-Sept15-22-Joe-Biden-tuxedo-ap-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/09/man-head-bowed-maga-hat-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/GettyImages-1242677816-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/09/GettyImages-1131471275-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/09/GettyImages-1407915026-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/09/Migrants-200x150.jpeg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/GettyImages-1232419046-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "description": "Rep.
